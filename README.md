SNHU Module 7-3 Project Three Corner Grocer

# WHAT IS THIS PROJECT?
  This is a program for Corner Grocer. Corner Grocer requested a simple program to take a list of items, and count them. 
They requested the program to provide four menu options:
1. Search for a specific item, and return a count of that item
2. Print a list of each item with the total of each item
3. Print a list of each item with the total of each item as a tally
4. Quit

Upon opening the program, the file is supposed to be backed up to a separate file.

# WHAT DID I DO WELL?

  The program mostly works as intended. You are able to go through all menu options, and each works. I think the best part
of this project was working with the initial file and outputting the item counts.

# IMPROVEMENTS

  While it functions fine, this program was not built correctly. I had very little time to complete this program due
to personal life, and was not able to create a correct class structure. I actually had the program done without a
class implementation, then realised that was a requirement, and quickly went back and added a class. That is why its
a messy structure that should not be used ever again, but it works. If a class was properly done, then it would be
easier to add features like prices in the future.

# CHALLENGES

  This program overall was not particularly difficult, just a little time consuming to get everything working right. 
The most challenging part was probably getting the tally function functional, which I looked online for examples of 
different programs using tally counts and used that knowledge in mine. Maps were also somewhat difficult to understand,
but again, I used online resources to help learn how to use them.

# TRANSFERABLE SKILLS

  This simple program helped develop skills that will be used elsewhere, the most notable being working with external
files in a simple text format. I know I will be using this skill again.

# PROGRAM MAINTAINABILITY

  This program is not very adaptable as is. If I had the time, I would have added a better class structure to make adding
other details easy. It is, however, fairly simple and clean in my opinion. The entire main CPP file is only 53 lines, with
all required functions in a separate h file. I think it is easy to understand with no black magic voodoo going on.
